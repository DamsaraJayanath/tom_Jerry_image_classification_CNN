# Tom & Jerry Image Classification using CNN

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the popular cartoon **Tom and Jerry**.  
The model identifies the presence of characters in an image and classifies it into **four distinct categories**.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate **practical deep learning skills** using **TensorFlow and Keras**, covering:
- Data preprocessing
- CNN architecture design
- Model training and validation
- Overfitting handling
- Model evaluation and inference

This project is well-suited for showcasing **computer vision fundamentals** and **multi-class image classification**.

## Problem Statement
Given an input image extracted from **Tom & Jerry cartoon episodes**, the model predicts **which characters appear in the frame**.

This is a **multi-class image classification problem** with the following classes:

- **Tom** – Image contains only Tom  
- **Jerry** – Image contains only Jerry  
- **Tom & Jerry** – Image contains both characters  
- **Neither** – Image contains neither Tom nor Jerry  

---

## Dataset Description

- **Total images**: 5,478  
- **Source**: Kaggle  
- **Frame extraction**: 1 frame per second (1 FPS) from video clips  
- **Labeling**: Manually labeled (100% ground-truth accuracy)

## Model Architecture

Two CNN architectures were experimented with during this project.

### 🔹 Model 1 (Baseline CNN)
- Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers for spatial reduction
- Fully connected dense layers
- Softmax output for 4-class classification

### 🔹 Model 2 (Improved CNN – Final Model)
- Optimized number of convolution filters
- Dropout layer added to reduce overfitting
- Improved generalization on validation data

✔ **Model 2 achieved better validation performance and was selected as the final model.**

## Training Details

- **Framework**: TensorFlow & Keras  
- **Input image size**: 224 × 224  
- **Loss function**: Categorical Crossentropy  
- **Optimizer**: Adam  
- **Evaluation metrics**: Accuracy  
- **Data augmentation**:
  - Rotation
  - Width & height shift
  - Zoom
  - Horizontal flip  

- **Random seed fixed** for reproducibility

---

### Data Augmentation
- Rotation  
- Width & height shift  
- Zoom  
- Horizontal flip  

### Early Stopping & Best Model Selection
To prevent overfitting and ensure optimal generalization, **EarlyStopping** was used during training:

- **Monitored metric**: `val_loss`  
- **Patience**: 10 epochs  
- **Best weights restored automatically**

The training process automatically stopped when validation loss stopped improving, and the model weights were restored to the epoch with the **lowest validation loss**.

The final saved model represents the **best-performing version**, not necessarily the last training epoch.

---

## Results

- Training accuracy increased consistently
- Validation accuracy stabilized with reduced overfitting
- Best model selected based on **lowest validation loss**
- Model performs well on unseen images with reliable confidence scores

> Occasional misclassifications are expected due to challenging frames, occlusions, and distortions — reflecting real-world conditions.

## Model Inference

The trained model can:
- Predict the class of a given image
- Display the predicted label along with confidence score
- Visualize predictions on unseen test images

---

## Key Learnings

- Importance of **train–validation split**
- Handling **multi-class image classification**
- Preventing overfitting using **Dropout** and **EarlyStopping**
- Impact of **data augmentation**
- Interpreting validation metrics for model selection

---

## Future Improvements

- Apply **transfer learning** (e.g., MobileNetV2, ResNet)
- Perform detailed **error analysis**
- Implement **confusion matrix & class-wise accuracy**
- Extend to **object detection** instead of classification
