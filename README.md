# 🐱🐭 Tom & Jerry Image Classification using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the popular cartoon **Tom and Jerry**.  
The model identifies the presence of characters in an image and classifies it into **four distinct categories**.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate **practical deep learning skills** using **TensorFlow and Keras**, covering:
- Data preprocessing
- CNN architecture design
- Model training and validation
- Overfitting handling
- Model evaluation and inference

This project is well-suited for showcasing **computer vision fundamentals** and **multi-class image classification**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Given an input image extracted from **Tom & Jerry cartoon episodes**, the model predicts **which characters appear in the frame**.

This is a **multi-class image classification problem** with the following classes:

- **Tom** – Image contains only Tom  
- **Jerry** – Image contains only Jerry  
- **Tom & Jerry** – Image contains both characters  
- **Neither** – Image contains neither Tom nor Jerry

## 📊 Dataset Description

- **Total images**: 5,478  
- **Source**: Kaggle  
- **Frame extraction**: 1 frame per second (1 FPS) from video clips  
- **Labeling**: Manually labeled (100% ground-truth accuracy)
