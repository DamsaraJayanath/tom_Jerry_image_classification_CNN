🐱🐭 Tom & Jerry Image Classification using CNN
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the popular cartoon Tom & Jerry.
The model analyzes each image and identifies which characters appear in the frame, classifying it into four meaningful categories.

The project demonstrates a real-world multi-class image classification problem, covering the complete deep learning pipeline:

Data preprocessing

CNN architecture design

Model training and validation

Overfitting reduction

Model evaluation and inference
